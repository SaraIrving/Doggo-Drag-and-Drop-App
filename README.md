Doggo Drag and Drop is a simple front end drag and drop app where users are shown pictures of dogs. They can drag the ones they like into the "keepers" list, reorder them to their preferences and get rid of any they don't by "sending them to the farm". The app uses react-beautiful-dnd, the npm dog-names package and retrieves the pictures from the external Dog API.
